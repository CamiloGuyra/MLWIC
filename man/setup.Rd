\description{
\code{setup} installs necessary R packages on your computer. You will
need to run this before running \code{classify} and \code{train}. If this is your first time using
this function, you should see additional documentation at https://github.com/mikeyEcology/MLWIC .
If you follow the link to install Anacoda for Python 2.7, it should be in the default location.
