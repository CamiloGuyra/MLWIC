\title{Train a machine learning model to classify images}
\usage{
train(path_prefix = paste0(getwd(), "/images"), data_info = paste0(getwd(),
  "/image_labels.csv"), model_dir = getwd(), python_loc = "/anaconda2/bin/",
  num_gpus = 2, num_classes = 28, delimiter = ",",
  architecture = "resnet", depth = "18", log_dir_train = "train_output")
}
\arguments{
\item{path_prefix}{Absolute path to location of the images on your computer}

\item{data_info}{csv with file names for each photo (absolute path to file). This file must have no headers (column names).
column 1 must be the file name of each image including the extention (i.e., .jpg). Column 2
must be a number corresponding to the species. Give each species (or group of species) a
number identifying it. The first species must be 0, the next species 1, and so on.}

\item{model_dir}{Absolute path to the location where you stored the L1 folder
that you downloaded from github.}

\item{python_loc}{The location of python on your machine.}

\item{num_gpus}{The number of GPUs available. If you are using a CPU, leave this as default.}

\item{num_classes}{The number of classes (species or groups of species) in your model.}

\item{delimiter}{this will be a `,` for a csv.}

\item{architecture}{the architecture of the deep neural network (DNN). Resnet-18 is the default.
Other options are c("alexnet", "densenet", "googlenet", "nin", "vgg")}

\item{depth}{the number of layers in the DNN. If you are using resnet, the options are c(18, 34, 50, 101, 152).
If you are using densenet, the options are c(121, 161, 169, 201)
If you are an architecture other than resnet, the number of layers will be automatically set.}

\item{log_dir_train}{directory where you will store the model information.
This will be called when you what you specify in the \code{log_dir} option of the
\code{classify} function. You will want to use unique names if you are training
multiple models on your computer; otherwise they will be over-written.}

\description{
\code{train} allows users to train their own machine learning model using images
that have been manually classified. We recommend having at least 2,000 images per species,
but accuracies will be higher with > 10,000 images. This model will take a very long
time to run. We recommend using a GPU if possible. In the \code{data_info} csv, you must
have two columns with NO HEADERS. Column 1 must be the file name of the image. Column 2
must be a number corresponding to the species. Give each species (or group of species) a
number identifying it. The first species must be 0, the next species 1, and so on. If this is your first time using
this function, you should see additional documentation at https://github.com/mikeyEcology/MLWIC .
This function uses absolute paths, but if you are unfamilliar with this
process, you can put all of your images, the image label csv ("data_info") and the L1 folder that you
downloaded following the directions at https://github.com/mikeyEcology/MLWIC into one directory on
your computer. Then set your working directory to this location and the function will find the
absolute paths for you.
